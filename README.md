# retrosheet-events

Creating a tool to parse the [Retrosheet.org Game Event Files](https://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm) 
and loading the data into MariaDB/MySQL, Postgres, and SQLite.

# _This is still a work in progress, it is not ready for use_

Stay tuned, when its ready you'll know and the data will be available in my [Baseball Stats DB](https://github.com/rippinrobr/baseball-stats-db) project
